# Image-classification
Image classifier implemented with weka and the decision tree algorithm

This is a simple implementation that shows how to use java and weka library to implement a binary image classifier. 
The program relies on the decision tree algorithm to build a classifier which distinguishes butterflies from owls.

The dataset is taken from the imageFilters1.0.3 package (http://weka.sourceforge.net/packageMetaData/imageFilters/index.html) released by Dr Michael Mayo from The University of WAIKATO. It originally contains 100 images 
(50 images for butterflies and 50 images for owls). I have split it up into two groups of data: 90 training data ( 45 butterflies and 45 owls) and
10 test data (5 butterflies and 5 owls)
